as in most stuffed pepper recipes it's important to pick your peppers for this specifically, ones with flat bottoms so that they'll stand up while cooking in the oven.
i used basmati rice, since it was what i had on hand at the time, of course i'm sure that almost any rice would work.
i made way too much stuffing the first time i made this, any leftovers, make a decent stuffing for tomatos as well, even a side salad for another meal, it gets better with a little time.
i prefer my peppers cooked and slightly soft but still crisp, length of time in the oven is according to preference.
always an option to sprinkle with cheese about 10 minutes before done as well.",91
